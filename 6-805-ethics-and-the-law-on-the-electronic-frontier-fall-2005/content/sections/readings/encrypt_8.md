The following Top Secret memo from Brent Scowcroft to George Bush, written and the end of 1991 (and declassified in 1996) shows Bush's approval of a plan to have the Justice Department prepare legislation to deal with digital telephony problem, and to follow through to address encryption about a year later.

These documents were obtained in 1996 by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, under the Freedom of Information Act.
